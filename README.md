theGame was created using Phaser. The main focus was to create a game that required a lot of uer interaction and skill. It is meant to be played with a keyboard and mouse. Because of time constraints, there is only one level with rolling rounds that get more difficult each round. Once you character is killed, it displays your score and the game is restarted. Goals in the future include to create a full world with multiple levels, different class/attacks and less defined goals. The bulk of the game code is in the play.js file while load.js contains all of the assets.
